## How do i run the app/website?

### `npm start`

Launches the development build in the interactive watch mode.\
I do not recommend using this in production

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Code Splitting

Most of the codes in this website are turned into components. So if you wanna make changes, its just as easy for you. ```Most of the things you would need to edit are in the src/components/miniComponentsIGLOL Folder```

### Deployment
```
Download or Clone the website
Go into the folder
Do npm install
Then run npm start for development
            OR
Run npm run build for a production build
```
